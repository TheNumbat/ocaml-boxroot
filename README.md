# Boxroot: fast movable roots for the OCaml C interface

This repository hosts an experiment with a different root-registration
API for the OCaml garbage collector. The new kind of roots are called
`boxroot` (boxed roots).

The traditional root-registration APIs let users decide which existing
parts of memory should be considered as new roots by the runtime. With
boxroots, it is our allocator, not the user, that decides where these
roots are placed in memory. This extra flexibility allows for a more
efficient implementation.

We provide an implementation of this idea as a standalone C library
([boxroot/](boxroot/) in this repository), as a custom allocator using
OCaml's GC scanning hooks. Our prototype already shows promising
performance in benchmarks.

In addition to better performance, movable roots fit a common use-case
where Ocaml values are placed inside malloc'ed blocks and then
registered as global roots, for instance for insertion in C library
data structures. This pattern appears to be common. Our original
motivation for prototyping boxroots generalises that: it is to propose
an idiomatic manipulation of OCaml roots from Rust, similar to
`Box<T>` pointers.

## Design

Functions to acquire, read, release and modify a `boxroot` are
provided as follows.

```c
boxroot boxroot_create(value);
value boxroot_get(boxroot);
value const * boxroot_get_ref(boxroot);
void boxroot_delete(boxroot);
void boxroot_modify(boxroot *, value);
```

These functions operate in constant time. (This can be compared to the
probabilistic logarithmic time offered by global roots.)

See [boxroot/boxroot.h](boxroot/boxroot.h) for API documentation.

## Benchmarks

To evaluate our experiment, we run various allocation-heavy
benchmarks.

### Implementations

The benchmarks compares various implementation of an OCaml reference
type Ref containing a single value with an imperative interface
(`create`, `get`, `delete`, `modify`):

- `ocaml`: a pure-OCaml implementation using plain references,
- `gc`: a C implementation using `caml_alloc_small(1,0)`,
- `boxroot`: an abstract block (in the OCaml heap) containing a
  `boxroot`,
- `global`: an abstract block (allocated outside the OCaml heap)
  containing a global root, and
- `generational`: an abstract block (outside the heap) containing a
  generational global root.

By selecting different implementations of Ref, we can evaluate the
overhead of root registration and scanning for various
implementations, compared to a pure OCaml implementation.

### Permutations of a list

The small program used in this benchmark computes the set of all
permutations of the list [0; ..; n-1], using a non-determinism monad
represented using (strict) lists. (This is an exponential way to
compute factorial(n) with lots of allocations.)

In our non-determinism monad, each list element goes through the Ref
module that boxes its underlying value, and may be implemented
(through C stubs) as an abstract block (not followed by the GC) whose
value is registered as a GC root.

This benchmark creates a lot of roots alive at the same time.

### Synthetic benchmark

In this benchmark, we allocate and deallocate values and roots
according to probabilities determined by parameters.

* `N=8`: log_2 of the number of minor generations
* `SMALL_ROOTS=10_000`: the number of small roots allocated (in the
  minor heap) per minor collection,
* `LARGE_ROOTS=20`: the number of large roots allocated (in the major
  heap) per minor collection,
* `SMALL_ROOT_PROMOTION_RATE=0.2`: the survival rate for small roots
  allocated in the current minor heap,
* `LARGE_ROOT_PROMOTION_RATE=1`: the survival rate for large roots
  allocated in the current minor heap,
* `ROOT_SURVIVAL_RATE=0.99`: the survival rate for roots that survived
  a first minor collection,
* `GC_PROMOTION_RATE=0.1`: promotion rate of GC-tracked values,
* `GC_SURVIVAL_RATE=0.5`: survival rate of GC-tracked values.

These settings favour the creation of a lot of roots, most of which
are short-lived. Roots that survive are few, but they are very
long-lived.

### Some numbers on one of our machine

```
$ make run
Benchmark: perm_count
---
ocaml: 4.00s
count: 3628800
---
gc: 4.07s
count: 3628800
---
boxroot: 4.02s
count: 3628800
---
global: 43.35s
count: 3628800
---
generational: 9.31s
count: 3628800
---
Benchmark: synthetic
---
ocaml: 19.24s
---
gc: 17.65s
---
boxroot: 15.88s
---
global: 39.50s
---
generational: 25.10s
---
```

We see that global roots add a large overhead, which is reduced by
using generational global roots. Boxroots outperform generational
global roots, and are competitive with the reference implementations
that do not use roots (ocaml and gc).

Since the boxroot is directly inside a gc-allocated value, our
benchmarks leave few opportunities for the version using boxroots
outperforming the versions without roots. The repeatable
outperformance of non-roots versions by the boxroot version in the
second case could be explained by the greater cache locality of
pointers to the heap during scanning.

## Implementation

We implemented a custom allocator that manages fairly standard
freelist-based memory pools, but we make arrangements such that we can
scan these pools efficiently. In standard fashion, the pools are
aligned in such a way that the most significant bits can be used to
identify the pool from the address of their members. Since elements of
the freelist are guaranteed to point only inside the memory pool, and
non-immediate OCaml values are guaranteed to point only outside of the
memory pool, we can identify allocated slots as follows:

```
allocated(slot, pool) ‚âù (pool != (slot & ~(1<<N - 2)))
```

N is a parameter determining the size of the pools. The bitmask is
chosen to preserve the least significant bit, so that immediate OCaml
values (with lsb set) are correctly classified.

Scanning is set up by registering a root scanning hook with the OCaml
GC, and done by traversing the pools linearly. An early-exit
optimisation when all roots have been found ensures that programs that
use few roots throughout the life of the program only pay for what
they use.

The memory pools are managed in several rings, distinguished by their
*class* and their *occupancy*. In addition to distinguishing the pools
in use (which need to be scanned) from the pools that are free (and
need not be scanned), the class distinguishes pools according to OCaml
generations. A pool is *young* if and only if it is allowed to contain
pointers to the minor heap. During minor collection, we only need to
scan young pools. At the end of the minor collection, the young pools,
now guaranteed to no longer point to any young value, are promoted
into *old* pools.

In addition to distinguishing pools that are available for allocation
from pools that are (quasi-)full, occupancy distinguishes the old
pools that are quite more empty than others. By this we mean
half-empty. Such pools are considered in priority for *demotion* into
a young pool. (These pool contain major roots, but it is harmless to
scan them during minor collection.) If no such pool is available for
recycling into a young pool, we prefer to allocate a new pool.

This heuristic of choosing pools at least half-empty guarantees that
more than half of the scanning effort during minor collection is
devoted to slots containing young values, or available for the
allocation of young values (disregarding some optimisation in
`boxroot_modify`). This amounts to trading efficiency guarantees of
scanning against a slightly sub-optimal overall occupancy.

## Limitations

* Our prototype library uses `posix_memalign`, which currently limits
  its portability on some systems.

* No synchronisation is performed yet, which makes it unsafe to use
  with threads, including OCaml system threads unless care is taken
  not to release boxroots without possessing the runtime lock. We
  intend to lift this limitation in the future.

* Due to limitations of the GC hook interface, no work has been done
  to scan roots incrementally. Holding a large number of roots at the
  same time can negatively affect latency.
