# Experimenting with OCaml GC root registration

This repository hosts an experiment with a different root-registration
API for the OCaml garbage collector. The new kind of roots are called
"boxroot" (inspired by the `Box<T>` type of Rust).

The traditional root-registration APIs let users decide which existing
parts of memory should be considered as new roots by the runtime. With
boxroots, it is the runtime, not the user, that decides where to these
roots are placed in memory. This extra flexibility should allow for
a more efficient implementaion.

We provide an implementation of this idea as a standalone library
(`boxroot/` in this repository), using OCaml's GC scanning hooks. Due
to limitations of the hook interface, there are aspects of the
implementation that we cannot control as we would like (in particular,
we cannot support incremental scanning of major-heap hooks), but our
prototype performance is already promising.


Note: our prototype library uses `aligned_alloc`, which might limit
its portability on some systems. (On OSX we reimplement the missing
`aligned_alloc` on top of `posix_memalign`, but some systems may lack
`posix_memalign`.)

## Benchmarks

To evaluate our experiment, we run various allocation-heavy
benchmarks.

### Permutations of a list

The small program used in this benchmark computes the set of all
permutations of the list [0; ..; n-1], using a non-determinism monad
represented using (strict) lists. (This is an exponential way to
compute factorial(n) with lots of allocations.)

A reference implementation in OCaml is provided, but point is to
implement the non-determinism monad list in C, with each element of
the list registered as a root to the OCaml GC.

#### Implementations

Currently we have implemented:
- `choice_ocaml_persistent`: a reference implementation in OCaml
- `choice_ocaml_ephemeral`: like the previous, with update-in-place
  for lists like the C implementations below
- `choice_gc`: a reference implementation in C,
  using lists managed by the OCaml GC (no per-element root)
- `choice_global_roots`: a global root per element
- `choice_generational_roots`: a generational global root per element
- `choice_boxroots`: like `choice_generational_roots`, but the root is
  movable (malloc'ed)
- `choice_fast_boxroots`: the real thing â€” like `choice_boxroots`, but
  by rolling out our own allocator for movable roots, and implementing
  a fast scanning of the roots registered with caml_scan_roots_hook.

#### Some numbers on my machine

```

We see that global roots add a large overhead (12s compared to 2s when
using the OCaml GC), which is largely reduced by using generational
global roots (4.3s).

"Fake" boxroots (generational roots made movable by placing them in
their owned malloc'ed value) are exactly as fast as generational
global roots.

Real boxroots (implemented with a custom allocator) are competitive
with implementations that do not use per-element roots.
